We will provide more documents soon. Right now, there are several source codes to learn about our contract language:

1. simple Uniswap-like contract: https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/flow/src/test/scala/org/alephium/flow/core/VMSpec.scala#L869-L977
2. there are more examples in the same file: https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/flow/src/test/scala/org/alephium/flow/core/VMSpec.scala
3. an integration test for the Uniswap-like exchange based on Rest API: https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/app/src/it/scala/org/alephium/app/SmartContractTest.scala
5. all of the built-ins: https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/protocol/src/main/scala/org/alephium/protocol/vm/lang/BuiltIn.scala#L195-L218 and https://github.com/alephium/alephium/blob/master/protocol/src/main/scala/org/alephium/protocol/vm/lang/BuiltIn.scala#L367-L393
