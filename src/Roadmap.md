# Roadmap

The network is young and growing rapidly. We will update the roadmap to reflect the latest priorities.

## Community development

- Coinmarketcap and Coingecko listings
CoinmarketCap listing Done https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/alephium/ (currently as an untracked project since there is no public market for ALPH)
Coingecko application form submitted
- Exchange listing: this is working in progress with highest priority
- Mining pool: this is working in progress with high priority
- Community bounty/grants program: this is started, need more time to polish details

## Core development

- Improve the UX for smart contract development. We will start to build some dApps once the endpoints are more mature
- Document the core design of Alephium, so that it is easier to onboard new developers
- Design and implement bridges to other chains. Several friends did some initial investigation
- Improve the robustness and efficiency of networking modules
- Improve IO efficiency of full node
- multi-node clique stabilization
