# Pool Mining Guide

We’re happy to see this list of pools grow and diversify. Please give them a try. Alephium is still very new and it is important that you keep an eye on updates. Remember that each pool has a thriving community with channels welcoming your support requests and questions. Therefore it is always best to ask your pool related questions in the concerned pool’s group. You may also find instructions in your own language in one of our [community playlists available here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIX9Eww2Kch7sc0E6gCmEdg/playlists)
