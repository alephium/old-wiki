# Download JAR
Download the executable file [alephium-0.10.2.jar](https://github.com/alephium/alephium/releases/download/v0.10.2/alephium-0.10.2.jar) (once it is downloaded, do not double click on it, it can not be launched this way).
Move the **alephium-0.10.2.jar** file in the **.alephium** folder.
If you’re on Mac, you might need to allow apps from unidentified devs, you can find how-to online.

# Configure your node

1. In the .alephium folder create a new text file named `user.conf` and in the file copy/paste and save the following text (Use `TextEdit` on Macos and `NotePad` on Windows)

```
alephium.network.network-id = 1
alephium.discovery.bootstrap = ["18.185.54.38:9973", "3.141.11.239:9973", "54.79.138.71:9973"]
```

2. Make sure to change the format of the text to plain text:
 - MacOS: Format -> Make plain text.
 - Windows: When you save the file, select `type -> All files`, not `txt`.

NOTE: If you are upgrading from a previous release, please ensure the folder .alephium is clean of any `db-*` folders

# Start your node

1. Open the search and type in `Terminal` (for Mac) or `Windows Terminal` (for  Windows).

2. Open the Terminal/Command Line program and navigate to the **.alephium** folder.

* Type `ls` and press Enter to list the folders on your computer.

* Navigate to the **.alephium** folder by typing `cd FolderName` to enter the folder in which the **.alephium** folder is saved. Please note that the **.alephium** folder is hidden so you won’t see it in the directory if you didn't executed step 3 of the requirements.

* Type `cd .alephium` to enter the folder.

3. Type the command `java -jar -Xmx500m alephium-0.10.2.jar` in the terminal and press Enter.

_**Tada your node is running**_

* Your node will start to sync with the network, it might be long the first time.
* Open [http://127.0.0.1:12973/docs](http://127.0.0.1:12973/docs) to see all interactions you can have with the node.
* If you close the terminal the node will be turned off.

# Future

Stay tuned for future release, you might need to download a new jar, to update your `bootstrap` addresses in your `user.conf` and delete the `db_*` folder in your `.alephium` folder.
